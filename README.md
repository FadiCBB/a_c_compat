==========


Background:
---------------------------
Compatibility layer between AGM (Authentic Gameplay Modification) and CSE (Combat Space Enhancement). Spun off from another project (cbb_a3_core) I maintain but without all the dependencies.

Because of the importance of the CSE medical menu, I've made some AGM features availible in the CSE action menu. Doesn't have to just be this way but it'd require someone elses contribution for it.

Not all AGM features will be covered. Again, if you want to contribute anything missing please do. That's the reason it's on Github and what not.

Included components:
---------------------------

  - **Barrel Swap**

    Required Component: AGM_Overheating

    Description: The ability to swap your barrel for a spare through the CSE menu.
    
  - **Check Temperature**

    Required Component: AGM_Overheating

    Description: The ability to check your weapons temperature through the CSE menu.

  - **Kestrel**

    Required Component: AGM_Wind

    Description: Opening and closing the Kestrel through the CSE menu.

  - **Explosives**

    Required Component: AGM_Explosives

  - **Team Colors**

    Required Component: AGM_Interaction

    Description: Allows you to set colors for your self or others in your team through the CSE menu.
    
    Note: Like in Arma 2, squad leads cannot color themselves. Using this however other team members can color the SL.

  - **Logistics**

    Required Component: AGM_Logistics

    Description: The ability to pick up spare tires, tracks and jerry cans using the CSE logistics system.

    Note: This will probably not be finished by me.

Ideas for any contributers:
---------------------------
- AGM_Hearing and putting earplugs in?
- Applying CSE unconscious state to AGM_GForces?
- Shoulder tapping?
